# sr-release

Tool for easy software release management. It generates CHANGELOG.md file based on git commits and creates git tags.
 In the process the tool is pushing the changes to the remote origin. 
 
# Install 
 
```
npm install -g sr-release
```

# Typical usage 

Run sr-release in the directory of your repo code.

## Detecting non-commited files

```
$ sr-release 
 M packages.ini
Please commit changes before you can generate changelog

```
In the example above sr-released detected that there are non-commited files and the process of software release cannot be continued.


## Generating CHANGELOG.md
If all files are committed we run the tool again form the main directory of the local project copy. 

For the first time it will look like this
```
Changelog doesn't exist. It will be generated 'CHANGELOG.md'
I'm generating changelog for project: sr-release
....
Generation succeeded. Please check file CHANGELOG.md and save your changes there and run sr-release again.

```

on the next attempts it will look like this:

```
$ sr-release
Changelog exist. File 'CHANGELOG.md' will be updated

```

The tool generates changes and saves them into CHANGELOG.md under section with headline "New Version Tag do not change this line". See below:

```
# Release notes for project sr-release


CHANGELOG
---------

### New Version Tag do not change this line


* Readme updates
* Initial implementation of basic functionality of sr-release tool.
* Initial commit

### 1.0.0


* si-upgrade for upgrading stages-interface 
* sr-release for software change log generation and automation for tags managment
* docker-nfs for setting nfs virtual /Users/xxx on docker-machine vm 


________

Generated by sr-release. 
```


This is the moment when the operator of the tool can update the changelog. He needs just after generating changelog go end edit the file in section which was just added. 
See that if you already have CHANGELOG.md then old changelogs are kept.
 
 
## Releasing software
When everything is ready and CHANGELOG.md was updated we just need to run the tool again and now the process will be ready for actual tagging and releasing the code.
The process should look like below. 

```
$ sr-release
Have you checked and updated CHANGELOG.md file? [y/N] y
Starting procedure of new release

The lastest tag is: 1.0.0
Enter the new tag and press [ENTER] 1.0.1
Updating CHANGELOG.md by the new tag 1.0.1
[develop 19ff088] Releasing new version 1.0.1

 * [new tag]         1.0.1 -> 1.0.1

```

sr-release asks the operator first if the updates in the CHANGELOG.md are finished:
```
Have you checked and updated CHANGELOG.md file? [y/N]
```
 Then it shows the lastest tag if any exists and asks for new one. 
 
```
 The lastest tag is: 1.0.0
 Enter the new tag and press [ENTER]
```
 Then the rest is automated.
